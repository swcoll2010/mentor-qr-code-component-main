## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS (SCSS)


### What I learned

Even with simple projects, it's easy to over complicate the coding, I've tried to ensure that I've minimised both the HTML and CSS whilst trying to remain faithful to the design brief.

Without the design files, the most I could do is eyeball the layout heights and gaps to ensure consistency with the preview images. This is similar to working with a designer who isn't using Web based screen widths, but is doing layout based on their usual print sizing.

### Continued development

Future development, deepen knowledge of semantic HTML, whilst laying the foundation for both hooking in CSS and JS, their appears to be some tension here in some ways, and choosing the based path is not always clear cut at the moment.

Investigate the use of PostCSS and it's future's modules (tooling support doesn't seem great for this at the moment). Deepen knowledge of SASS, at the moment I'm using basic features and this might be why looking at PostCSS is advantageous in the short term.

### Useful resources

As ever, MDN and CSS Tricks are really useful reference documentation. With CSS Tricks being a good resource for ideas in addition to best practice guides.
